## Overview of the school district analysis:

Following notice of possible academic dishonesty among ninth graders at Thomas High School, we have modified our previous analysis to exclude math and reading scores from Thomas High School's ninth grade.

## The adjusted analysis
- The School District Summary, with all scores, are as shown:

  The adjusted School District Summary shows minimal change to average scores and minimal change to the numbers of students passing math, reading, and the   combination of the two.

- The School Summary is unchanged for fourteen of the fifteen schools in the previous analysis. Only Thomas High School (third from bottom) is affected       with the removal of ninth grade scores.

- The changes for Thomas High School are not significant without the ninth grade scores. The drop for each category was less than one-half of a percentage   point with the exception of the Average Reading Score, which went **UP** by .58 percent.

- Math and reading scores by grade are completely unaffected for Grades Ten, Eleven, and Twelve. However, Grade Nine only has the scores for fourteen of     the schools, with Thomas High School as the glaring "nan" in reports, with Math below as an example:

- Thomas High School is a medium-sized school with 1,635 students, including the ninth graders, of course. Following the adjusted data, average math and     reading scores were virtually unchanged for the category of medium-sized schools:

- The Spending Summary (below) shows the percentages of student scores separated by ranges of dollar amounts. For Thomas High School, who spends $638         per student and is placed at the very center of the $631-645 range, continues to maintain higher scores than other schools with similar spending.
